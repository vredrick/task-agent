Get a team of specialized AI agents in Claude Code with just 2 commands! Each agent (code reviewer, debugger, test runner, etc.) appears as a separate tool, giving you instant access to focused expertise.

## üéØ What You Get

### BMad Methodology Agents (NEW!)

## üöÄ Quick Install (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Install the package
```bash
python3 -m pip install task-agents-mcp
```

### Step 2: Add to Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add task-agent task-agent -s project
```

That's it! ‚úÖ Claude Code will ask for approval, then you're ready to use your agents.

## üí¨ How to Use

### BMad Workflow Example
Follow the BMad methodology for complete project development:

```
# 1. Start with discovery
"Use analyst to research the market for a task management app"

# 2. Define product requirements  
"Use pm to create a PRD based on the analysis"

# 3. Design the user experience
"Use ux_expert to create UI specifications"

# 4. Create technical architecture
"Use architect to design the system architecture"

# 5. Validate and prepare work
"Use po to validate the PRD and architecture alignment"

# 6. Create developer stories
"Use sm to create the next story for development"

# 7. Implement the code
"Use dev to implement the story"

# 8. Review and improve
"Use qa to review the implementation"
```

### Quick Agent Commands
```
"Use analyst to brainstorm ideas for [project]"
"Use pm to create a PRD for [feature]"
"Use architect to design API for [service]"
"Use dev to implement [story]"
"Use qa to review recent changes"
```

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Claude Code CLI ([Download here](https://claude.ai/download))

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Agents

Want to create your own specialized agents? Just:

1. Create a `task-agents` folder in your project:
   - **Quick way**: Run `/task-agents` in Claude Code to copy all default agents
   - **Manual way**: Create the folder and add your own agent files
2. Add agent config files (`.md` with YAML frontmatter)
3. Restart - your custom agents appear automatically!

[See examples below](#creating-custom-agents)

## üñ•Ô∏è Also Works with Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-agent": {
      "command": "task-agent"
    }
  }
}
```

For custom agents in Claude Desktop, add the path:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-agent": {
      "command": "task-agent",
      "env": {
        "TASK_AGENTS_PATH": "/path/to/your/task-agents"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and use the same commands!

## üí° Examples

### BMad Agent Examples
```
# Research and ideation
"Use analyst to research competitors in the e-commerce space"

# Product planning
"Use pm to create a PRD for a shopping cart feature"

# Design
"Use ux_expert to create UI mockups for the checkout flow"

# Architecture
"Use architect to design microservices architecture"

# Story creation
"Use sm to create the next implementation story"

# Development
"Use dev to implement story-001 from /docs/stories/"

# Quality assurance
"Use qa to review and refactor the shopping cart implementation"
```

## Creating Custom Agents

1. Create `task-agents/my-agent.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   agent-name: Security Auditor
   description: Security vulnerability detection specialist
   tools: Read, Grep, Search, Bash
   model: opus
   cwd: .
   optional:
     resume-session: true 10  # Enable session resumption
     resource_dirs: ./security-tools  # Access additional directories
   ---
   
   System-prompt:
   You are a security specialist focused on finding vulnerabilities...
   ```

2. That's it! Use with: `"Have security_auditor check for SQL injection"`

### Resource Directories (NEW!)
Agents can now access additional directories beyond their working directory:

```yaml
optional:
  resource_dirs: ./bmad-core  # Single directory
  # OR
  resource_dirs: ./templates, ./data, ./scripts  # Multiple directories
```

This allows agents to access shared resources, templates, and tools.

### Session Resumption (v2.5.0+)

Agents can now maintain context across multiple exchanges! Add to any agent:

```yaml
optional:
  resume-session: true      # 5 exchanges (default)
  resume-session: true 10   # 10 exchanges  
  resume-session: false     # Disabled
```

Perfect for:
- Multi-step debugging sessions
- Feature implementation across multiple files
- Extended code reviews
- Iterative optimization

## üß™ Test It Out

```bash
# Quick test with BMad agents
claude "Use analyst to brainstorm ideas for a todo app"

# See all available agents
claude "Show available agents using agents://list"

# Start a full BMad workflow
claude "Use analyst to research the market for a project management tool"
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "command not found: task-agent"
```bash
# Make sure you installed it:
python3 -m pip install task-agents-mcp
```

### "spawn task-agent ENOENT"
```bash
# Reinstall the package:
python3 -m pip install --upgrade task-agents-mcp
```

### Agents not showing up?
- Restart Claude Code/Desktop
- Check Python version: `python3 --version` (need 3.10+)
