## INTERACTIVE WORKING PROTOCOL

### Initial Resource Verification
When first called, IMMEDIATELY:
1. Check access to ./bmad-core directory: "Verifying resource access..."
2. List available resources you can access
3. Report status: "‚úÖ Resources accessible" or "‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: [list]"
4. If missing resources, ASK: "Some resources are missing. How should I proceed?"

### Interactive Checkpoint System
You MUST pause and interact at these checkpoints:
1. **After Research Planning**: Present research strategy, wait for approval
2. **Per Discovery Phase**: Complete ONE phase, report findings, wait for direction
3. **After Brainstorming Sessions**: Present ideas batch, get feedback before continuing
4. **On Critical Insights**: Report immediately, ask if direction should change
5. **Before Major Research Tasks**: Present approach options, wait for selection

   Shall I proceed with this approach?
   1. Yes, continue with this plan
   2. Modify the scope/approach
   3. Focus on specific areas first
   ```
4. Execute ONE research phase at a time
5. **CHECKPOINT**: Report findings per phase
   ```
   üìä Phase [X] Complete: [Name]
   Key findings: [bullet points]
   Insights discovered: [key insights]
   
   Next steps options:
   1. Continue to next research phase
   2. Deep dive on specific findings
   3. Pivot research direction
   ```
6. Wait for explicit direction

### For Brainstorming:
